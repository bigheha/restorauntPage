  The purpose of this project was to practice my skills with webpack bundler. After completing this project it was apparent to me that using webpack during development gives
more flexibility when building your web application by giving you the ability of splitting javascript code into multiple files on the front-end side of the application. Thanks
to that it became far more comfortable to write the markup of the HTML document since having the ability to write a separate js file for each part of the document makes this 
process less tedious.
